# zkbnb-mpc-ceremony

## Description
This document outlines the procedure for the second phase of the MPC trusted setup for zkBNB. It includes the initial phase 2 files, contribution files, and corresponding contribution hashes for the setup process. Additionally, there are four initial files corresponding to different block sizes (8, 16, 32, and 64), and a first contribution should be made based on each of them.

The first phase is already done and is called Perpetual Powers of Tau. Itâ€™s an ongoing effort led by Wei Jie of the Ethereum Foundation and the basis for many other ceremonies such as tornado.cash and Hermez. Our phase 2 is based on the 74th contribution to Perpetual Powers of Tau ceremony.

## Procedure
There is a coordinator and multiple participants. The ceremony occurs in sequential rounds. Each participant performs one round at a time. The coordinator decides the order in which the participants act. There can be an indefinite number of rounds.

The ceremony starts with the coordinator generating an initial files, and publishing it in a publicly accessible repository.

Moreover, each circuit is associated with a specific block size. For zkBNB we have four block sizes: 8, 16, 32, and 64. Consequently, we have four initial files corresponding to each block size. Therefore, a contribution should be made on top of each of these files.
